        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hi my name is Axel Kreusel — I've been gardening for 4 years and I am happy to say that I started The Spicy Sprout as a pretty big side hustle. I'm still in school but I sell what I grow to share what I love! -Axel Kreusel

        <h2>About the Garden</h2>
        <p>
            I started gardening right here in Mueller quite a while back — and yes that DOES mean that I have a very small space, but I love the garden that I've made. All the beds were DIY-ed with a manual saw and a pair of hands. I try to use vertical growing as an advantage to the small yard space. I always work hard every day to make the most local and fresh salsa in Texas! -also Axel Kreusel

        <h2>The Spicy Sprout's Salsa</h2>
        <p>
            I make my salsa from scratch everyday, making sure that everything is fresh and tasty. At The Spicy Sprout it's not just salsa, it's pure flavor and freshness packed into a jar — no junk, no preservatives, no store-bought anything. We bring Local to a whole new level. From one Texan to another –Axel Kreusel

            Small batch. Big flavor. Dangerously delicious.

        <h2>The Nursery</h2>
        <p>
            Over the winter I propagate nice and leafy figs. They are easy to grow and a great pick if you need something you don't need to water too much 😅. I also sell various sprouts such as cucumbers, tomatoes, and watermelons. Wishing you the best luck in the garden –Axel Kreusel
